## Quadratic Function Minimization

Explore the basics of gradient descent by minimizing the quadratic function \( f(x) = x^2 \). The included Python script, `quadratic_function_minimization.py`, demonstrates the application of gradient descent to find the minimum of this simple function.

## Log-Likelihood Function Minimization

Delve into a more complex optimization scenario by minimizing the log-likelihood function \( -\ln(p^5(1-p)^3) \). The Python script `log_likelihood_function_minimization.py` showcases the application of gradient descent to optimize this function.
